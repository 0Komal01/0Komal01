## 🚀 About Me

👋 Hi! I’m a **Penultimate-Year Computer Engineering student at Marwadi University**, driven by curiosity and a passion for building impactful, real-world tech solutions. I’m deeply interested in **AI/ML, data analytics, backend engineering, and full-stack development**, and I enjoy exploring how intelligent systems and efficient software come together to solve complex problems.

💡 I love working on projects that challenge my thinking—whether it’s analyzing data, creating smart systems, or developing scalable web applications. I’m also actively involved in **research**, where I get to explore new ideas, experiment, and push my technical understanding further.

🛠️ **Technologies I work with:**

* **Android Applications** using Kotlin language
* **.NET** for backend and full-stack applications
* **Python** (Data Analytics, Machine Learning, Automation)
* **Java** & **Data Structures & Algorithms** for problem-solving
* **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)
* SQL, MongoDB, REST APIs, and various developer tools

🚀 I’m constantly learning, improving, and building—whether it's contributing to open-source projects, creating new applications, or improving my skills in AI/ML and data-driven development.

📚 Outside of coding, I enjoy researching emerging technologies, exploring AI trends, and finding new ways to grow as an engineer.
